American Express Authorizations
An American Express merchant ID consists of the 10-digit numeric value (referred to as “SE
number” by American Express) or two-character alphanumeric IATA airline code (which may be
followed by the IATA travel agent ID, T + 5-8 digits, separated by a space). Since DE 42 is
defined as ans-15, an American Express 10-digit SE number in character format should be leftjustified
and followed by trailing spaces. This 10-digit number also should pass the Modulus 9
check digit routine.
DE 43 (Acceptor Name and Location)
DE 43 (Acceptor Name and Location) contains the name and location of the acceptor point of
interaction.
