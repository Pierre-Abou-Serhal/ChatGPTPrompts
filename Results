Dears,

This is the Json Object that will be used for the onboarding process:

Find in Red the taxResidencyDetails.
In this object, there is three repetitive fields:

1.	haveTinNumber, haveTinNumber1, haveTinNumber2, haveTinNumber3
2.	countryOfTaxResidence, countryOfTaxResidence1, countryOfTaxResidence2, countryOfTaxResidence3
3.	tinNumber, tinNumber1, tinNumber2, tinNumber3

Will these fields always have a maximum number of 4 ? or can the customer have more than 4 tin numbers ?
