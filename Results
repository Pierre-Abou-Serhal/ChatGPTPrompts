Hello @Priyanka and @Rana,

We would like to confirm whether our current handling of the country_subdivision field in the recipient address object could cause any issues on your side in the PRODUCTION environment.

Specifically, we are doing the following:

If the recipient country is CAN, we are sending the static value "QC".

If the recipient country is USA, we are sending the static value "IL".


Please let us know if this approach is acceptable or if any adjustments are needed.
