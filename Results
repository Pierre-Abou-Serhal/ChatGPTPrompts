Dear Reine,

-	Issue related to “Beneficiary (file)” is now fixed, we need you to try and generate a T24 file again and then upload in to T24. Let us know if it worked.

-	Issue related to both accounts “010691404002422” and “010283427004422” were caused because T24 PROD and T24 UAT are not live synchronized,
So what happened is the following:
	010691404002422 on PROD is set as “Salary Account - Public sector” but on UAT it is still “Current Account”
	010283427004422 is found on PROD but is still not yet created on UAT
