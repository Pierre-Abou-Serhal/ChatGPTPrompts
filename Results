Hello @Priyanka and @Rana,

We want to ask you if what we are currently doing regarding the “country_subdivision” field in the recipient address object will not cause an issue from your side on PRODUCTION environment.
We are doing the following:
-	If the recipient country is “CAN” we will be sending the static value “QC” 
-	If the recipient country is “USA” we will be sending the static value “IL”
