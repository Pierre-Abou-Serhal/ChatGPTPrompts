	Dear Valued Partner, 
This communication provides important information regarding the renewal of the server certificate for the domain api.mastercard.com. Please review the details below to ensure uninterrupted connectivity. 
Q1. What is being done? 
Mastercard will renew the server certificate for the domain api.mastercard.com.

Q2. Why is this change needed? 
The current server certificate for api.mastercard.com expires on February 17, 2026. To ensure uninterrupted service, Mastercard will renew the certificate on February 10, 2026.

Q3. Are you impacted by this change? 
Please review the following criteria:
•    If you do not consume Mastercard APIs exposed on api.mastercard.com, you are NOT impacted.
•    If you consume api.mastercard.com but do not pin the public certificate using properties like serial number or fingerprint, you are NOT impacted.
•    If you consume api.mastercard.com and perform specific checks or validations based on the current certificate properties (e.g., serial number, fingerprint), you ARE impacted and action is required.
Q4. What action is needed from you? 
•    Mastercard strongly recommends to remove any checks and validations using current public certificate immediately. This will remove any tight coupling between server and client.
•    This will allow Mastercard to seamlessly renew its server certificate for the domain "api.mastercard.com" and save this effort around keeping the clients aligned with the changes.
•    However, if you as customer must have the public certificate of the server explicitly validated, then align to have your client updated with the new public certificate, provided below.
Q5. Can I update/trust the new certificate now? 
Depends on the client implementation. Any update/addition should be implemented using appropriate methods determined based on your specific implementation. 
•    If updating before our change window, ensure both old and new server certificate are allowed.
•    If you are looking to update, during or after our change window, please note, there could be service disruptions, due to TLS handshake failures.
Important: Only one certificate will be active on the server at any given time.
Q6. New Certificate Details: 
The certificate can be accessed via the Key Management Portal (KMP) in MCC.
Key details:
Subject: CN=api.mastercard.com, O=MasterCard International Incorporated, L=Waterloo, C=BE
Serial Number: 047DE5F8218D3AE743B9735490DC2590
SHA256 Fingerprint: 93:B2:81:7C:CF:DF:AA:26:D8:71:56:25:0C:66:49:E9:D6:45:25:0D:B2:37:89:DF:27:95:E1:49:DF:58:B5:10
SHA1 Fingerprint: 6E:E0:BB:CA:FB:80:06:D5:76:31:E8:63:E6:4B:19:4F:79:59:4D:DE
Note: Subject CN remains unchanged.

Q7. When the change will be activated on Mastercard end? 
The change will be deployed incrementally on the network upon the approval on Tue February 10th , 2026 between 9:00am - 5:00pm EDT (US Eastern) / 2:00pm - 10:00pm UTC.

Customers must update certificate before Tue February 10, 2026.

If customer fails to update certificate details all requests will begin to fail.

Q8. What should you do if you face errors during or after implementation window i.e., Tue February 10, 2026 between 9:00am - 5:00pm EDT (US Eastern) / 2:00pm - 10:00pm UTC? 
•    If clients fail to update the new certificate on their clients to be trusted/allowed for connecting with api.mastercard.com, then after the change on Mastercard servers, your client may start failing due to "TLS Handshake Failures".
Troubleshooting tip : Please enable detailed SSL/TLS handshake logging on your client, and observe the certificates being exchanged between your client and server. Please ensure the server certificate is being allowed in your client application.
•    For questions or concerns upon reception of this communication, reach Mastercard support team through Teams channel or Edge_as_a_Service_Support@mastercard.com.
