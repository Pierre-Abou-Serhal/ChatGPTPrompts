The issue was:
This customer have on T24 his Residence country set to "Canada".
Master card will make the field "country_subdivision" mandatory.
That's why we were receiving : MISSING_REQUIRED_INPUT for: sender.address.country_subdivision

The fix is to detect the senders Residence Country. If it is equal to USA or CAN, we automatically fill the sender country subdivision with the following values:
- USA: IL
- CAN: QC
