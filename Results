Subject: Customer Duplicate Detection – Non-Technical Explanation (How it works + Grading)

Hi all,

We’ve added a new feature in the KYC application to help detect **potential duplicate customers** and ensure we don’t create multiple profiles for the same person. Below is a non-technical explanation of **how the detection works** and **how the grading (score) is calculated**.

---

## 1) How duplicate detection works (in simple terms)

When a **new customer** is created, the system automatically checks if this person might already exist in the bank records.
This helps avoid:

* creating the same customer twice,
* splitting a customer’s information across multiple profiles,
* compliance/KYC duplication risks.

### Step 1 — “New customers to check”

Only customers that are still **pending validation** appear in the “New Customers” list.

### Step 2 — The system searches for possible matches

For each new customer, the system searches existing customers and compares the following information:

* First Name
* Family Name
* Father Name
* Mother Name
* Date of Birth
* Gender
* Register Place
* Register Number

### Step 3 — Smart comparison (not only exact match)

People’s names can be written differently (spelling variations, missing spaces, minor typos).
So the system performs two kinds of checks:

1. **Exact match checks**
   Certain fields must match exactly when present (for example: Date of Birth, Gender, Register Number).

2. **Similarity checks (for names)**
   Names are compared using a similarity approach that tolerates small spelling differences and minor errors.

### Step 4 — The system shows candidates for human validation

When a user selects a new customer, the system displays a list of **possible matching customers (candidates)**.
The user reviews the results and decides whether to link the new customer to an existing one, or confirm that no match exists.

Important note: **The system does not automatically merge customers.**
It suggests candidates and provides scoring, but **the final decision is always made by the user**.

## 2) How the grading system works

The grading is there to explain **how strong the match is** between the **New Customer** and each **Candidate Customer**.

### Grades per field

Each field shows a grade like:

**Grade = (earned points) / (maximum points)**
and also a **percentage (%)**

Meaning:

* If the field matches perfectly (or is very similar), it receives a high score.
* If it does not match, it receives a low score.
* Some fields may be more important than others, so they can have a higher maximum score.

### Total Grade

The system then calculates an overall score:

**Total Grade = sum of earned points / sum of maximum points**

So the Total Grade represents the overall match strength.

### How to interpret the % (general guidance)

* **High %** → very likely the same person
* **Medium %** → possible match, needs review
* **Low %** → likely not the same person

## 3) History tracking (audit)

All decisions are recorded in the “History” tab, including:

* whether a match was linked or “No match found” was selected,
* who validated it,
* and when it was done.

If you’d like, I can also provide a short one-page PDF version or add a quick real-life example (with typical spelling variations) to make the grading even easier to interpret.
