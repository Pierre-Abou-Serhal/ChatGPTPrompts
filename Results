Dears,

Since the Alterna Logger API is now being used by multiple applications, it is now crucial for debugging any issue that might occur on any application on PROD.

We need a way to know if for whatever reason the Alterna Logger Windows Service might stop. 

Can you assit us with this ?

Best Regards,
Pierre Abou Serhal.
