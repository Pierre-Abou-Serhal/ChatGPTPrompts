Dear All,

Please find below the JSON object intended for use in the onboarding process.

Highlighted in red are the taxResidencyDetails. Within this object, there are three sets of repetitive fields:

1. haveTinNumber, haveTinNumber1, haveTinNumber2, haveTinNumber3


2. countryOfTaxResidence, countryOfTaxResidence1, countryOfTaxResidence2, countryOfTaxResidence3


3. tinNumber, tinNumber1, tinNumber2, tinNumber3



Could you please confirm whether the number of these fields is fixed at a maximum of four, or if a customer can potentially have more than four TIN numbers?
