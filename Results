Here’s what we found and how we fixed it.

Root cause
The customer’s Residence Country in T24 is set to Canada. Mastercard is enforcing country_subdivision as mandatory for certain countries (including USA and CAN).
Because we weren’t sending that field, we received the error:

MISSING_REQUIRED_INPUT for: sender.address.country_subdivision

Fix
We now detect the sender’s Residence Country. If it is USA or CAN, we automatically populate sender.address.country_subdivision as follows:

USA → IL

CAN → QC
