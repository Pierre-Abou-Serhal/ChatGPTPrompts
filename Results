# Customer Duplicate Detection & Linking (KYC)

This feature helps KYC/Operations teams detect potential duplicate customers and **link a new customer to an existing (original) customer**, or explicitly confirm that **no match exists**. It also provides a **history screen** to audit what happened and who validated it.

---

## 1) What the feature does

### Detect screen
- Loads a list of **“New Customers”** that are pending duplicate verification.
- When the user clicks a row, the system fetches and displays **matched customers (candidates)** from the existing customer database.
- For each candidate, the UI shows:
  - Customer identity fields (name parts, DOB, gender, register place/number)
  - Per-field **grade** + **percentage**
  - A **Total Grade** aggregation for the candidate

### Linking actions
For the selected new customer, the user can:

1) **Link to a suggested candidate**  
   - Click the ✅ icon on a candidate row.
   - System links the new customer to that selected existing customer.

2) **Confirm “No Matching Customer Found”**  
   - Click **No Matching Customer Found**.
   - System records that the new customer has no duplicate match.

3) **Match a Custom Customer ID**  
   - Click **Match a Custom Customer ID**.
   - A popup asks the user to enter a Customer ID manually.
   - The input is validated (digits only, 1–7 digits, not zero).
   - If valid, the system links the new customer to that entered customer ID.
