Subject: Monitoring/Alerting for Alterna Logger Windows Service

Dears,

As the Alterna Logger API is now used by multiple applications, it has become a critical dependency for production troubleshooting and incident investigation.

To ensure continuity, we would like to set up a way to be notified if the Alterna Logger Windows Service stops for any reason (e.g., crash, unexpected shutdown, server issue).

Could you please assist us with implementing an alert/monitoring mechanism for this service?

Best regards,
Pierre Abou Serhal
