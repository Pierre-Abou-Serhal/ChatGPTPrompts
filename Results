1. Where can we find the API documentation? Is there a website or portal for it?


2. Are all the APIs free to use, or are some of them paid?


3. Will there be an API we can use to check if a card is eligible before doing a transaction?


4. What kind of security will the APIs use? OAuth 1.0 or OAuth 2.0?


5. Will we get test cards to use during development?


6. Is there a sandbox (test) environment where we can try out our APIs safely?


7. Is there a Pre-Production environment where we can test everything before going live?


8. Will you give us test cases? How should we test our setup? Will we have a technical support team to help us?


9. How can we know which APIs or project we should use for our specific needs?
